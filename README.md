# LiellaNG: Lightweight Intermediate-code transform Engine for Low-Level Assembling Next Generation

Liella is an AOT compiler designed for transforming Microsoft CLI Intermediate code into highly-optimized native code. 
Liella is oriented to low-level scenarios like system development, providing direct control to instruction-level  
operations as well as advanced features such as object-oriented programming, generic types and functional features.

ðŸš§ Development is in progress.
